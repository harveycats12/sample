        <p class="Bold" id="intro">introduction</p>

        <p>Let's say you're an executive at a large corporation. Your particular responsibilities include making sure that all of your employees have the right hardware and software they need to do their jobs. Buying computers for everyone isn't enough -- you also have to purchase software or software licenses to give employees the tools they require. Whenever you have a new hire, you have to buy more software or make sure your current software license allows another user. It's so stressful that you find it difficult to go to sleep on your huge pile of money every night.</p>

        <a target="_blank" href="images/cloud-computing-1.gif"> <img class="pic1" src="images/cloud-computing-1.gif" align="left"></a>
        <p> Soon, there may be an alternative for executives like you. Instead of installing a suite of software for each computer, you'd 
            only have to load one application. That application would allow workers to log into a Web-based service which hosts all the 
            programs the user would need for his or her job. Remote machines owned by another company would run everything from 
            e-mail to word processing to complex data analysis programs. It's called cloud computing, and it could change the entire 
            computer industry.</p>

        <p> In a cloud computing system, there's a significant workload shift. Local computers no longer have to do all the heavy lifting 
            when it comes to running applications. The network of computers that make up the cloud handles them instead. Hardware 
            and software demands on the user's side decrease. The only thing the user's computer needs to be able to run is the cloud 
            computing system's interface software, which can be as simple as a Web browser, and the cloud's network takes care of the 
            rest.</p>

        <p> There's a good chance you've already used some form of cloud computing. If you have an e-mail account with a Web-based 
            e-mail service like Hotmail, Yahoo! Mail or Gmail, then you've had some experience with cloud computing. Instead of 
            running an e-mail program on your computer, you log in to a Web e-mail account remotely. The software and storage for 
            your account doesn't exist on your computer -- it's on the service's computer cloud.</p>
        <p><a href="#top"><button>back to top</button></a></p>
            <br>
        <p class="Bold" id="cloudCB">Cloud Computing Basics</p>

        <a target="_blank" href="images/Cloud-Computing.jpg"><img class="pic2" src="images/cloudcomputing.jpg" align="right"></a>
        <p> When talking about a cloud computing system, it's helpful to divide it into two sections: the front end and the 
            back end. They connect to each other through a network, usually the Internet. The front end is the side the 
            computer user, or client, sees. The back end is the "cloud" section of the system.The front end includes the client's computer (or computer network) and the application required to access the cloud computing system. Not all cloud computing systems have the same user interface. Services like Web-based e-mail programs leverage existing Web browsers like Internet Explorer or Firefox. Other systems have unique applications that provide network access to clients.</p>

        <p> On the back end of the system are the various computers, servers and data storage systems that create the 
            "cloud" of computing services. In theory, a cloud computing system could include practically any computer 
            program you can imagine, from data processing to video games. Usually, each application will have its own 
            dedicated server.</p>

        <p> A central server administers the system, monitoring traffic and client demands to ensure everything runs 
            smoothly. It follows a set of rules called protocols and uses a special kind of software called middleware. 
            Middleware allows networked computers to communicate with each other. Most of the time, servers don't run 
            at full capacity. That means there's unused processing power going to waste. It's possible to fool a physical 
            server into thinking it's actually multiple servers, each running with its own independent operating system. The technique is called server virtualization. By maximizing the 
            output of individual servers, server virtualization reduces the need for more physical machines. 
            If a cloud computing company has a lot of clients, there's likely to be a high demand for a lot of storage space. Some companies require hundreds of digital storage devices. 
            Cloud computing systems need at least twice the number of storage devices it requires to keep all its clients' information stored. That's because these devices, like all 
            computers, occasionally break down. A cloud computing system must make a copy of all its clients' information and store it on other devices. The copies enable the central 
            server to access backup machines to retrieve data that otherwise would be unreachable. Making copies of data as a backup is called redundancy.</p>
        <p><a href="#top"><button>back to top</button></a></p>
                <br>
        <p class="Bold" id="cloudCA">Cloud Computing Applications </p>
        
        <a target="_blank" href="images/Cloud-computing-concept.png"> <img class="pic3" src="images/Cloud-computing-concept.png" align="center"></a>
        <p>The applications of cloud computing are practically limitless. With the right middleware, a cloud computing system could execute all the programs a normal computer could run.Potentially, everything from generic word processing software to customized computer programs designed for a specific company could work on a cloud computing system.Why would anyone want to rely on another computer system to run programs and store data? Here are just a few reasons: </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Clients would be able to access their applications and data from anywhere at any time. They could access the cloud computing system using any computer linked to the 
                    Internet. Data wouldn't be confined to a hard drive on one user's computer or even a corporation's internal network. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    It could bring hardware costs down. Cloud computing systems would reduce the need for advanced hardware on the client side. You wouldn't need to buy the fastest 
                    computer with the most memory, because the cloud system would take care of those needs for you. Instead, you could buy an inexpensive computer terminal. The 
                    terminal could include a monitor, input devices like a keyboard and mouse and just enough processing power to run the middleware necessary to connect to the cloud 
                    system. You wouldn't need a large hard drive because you'd store all your information on a remote computer. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Corporations that rely on computers have to make sure they have the right software in place to achieve goals. Cloud computing systems give these organizations 
                    company-wide access to computer applications. The companies don't have to buy a set of software or software licenses for every employee. Instead, the company could 
                    pay a metered fee to a cloud computing company. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Servers and digital storage devices take up space. Some companies rent physical space to store servers and databases because they don't have it available on site. Cloud 
                    puting gives these companies the option of storing data on someone else's hardware, removing the need for physical space on the front end. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Corporations might save money on IT support. Streamlined hardware would, in theory, have fewer problems than a network of heterogeneous machines and operating 
                    systems. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the cloud computing system's back end is a grid computing system, then the client could take advantage of the entire network's processing power. Often, scientists 
                    and researchers work with calculations so complex that it would take years for individual computers to complete them. On a grid computing system, the client could 
                    send the calculation to the cloud for processing. The cloud system would tap into the processing power of all available computers on the back end, significantly speeding 
                    up the calculation. 
                </li>

        <p> 
            Cloud computing issues span models (IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS) and types (public, private, or hybrid). Computing on 
            the cloud requires vigilance about security, manageability, standards, governance, and compliance: 
        </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Cloud security. The same security principles that apply to on-site computing apply to cloud computing 
                    security.
                    <br> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Identity management. Managing personal identity information so that access to computer 
                            resources, applications, data, and services is controlled properly. <br>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Detection and forensics. Separating legitimate from illegitimate activity. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Encryption. Coding to protect your information assets. 
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cloud manageability. You need a consistent view across both on-premises and cloud-based 
                    environments. This includes managing the assets provisioning as well as the quality of service (QOS) 
                    you’re receiving from your service provider. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cloud standards. A standard is an agreed-upon approach for doing something. Cloud standards ensure 
                    interoperability, so you can take tools, applications, virtual images, and more, and use them in 
                    another cloud environment without having to do any rework. Portability lets you take one application 
                    or instance running on one vendor’s implementation and deploy it on another vendor’s 
                    implementation. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cloud governance and compliance. Governance defines who’s responsible for what and the policies and procedures that your people or groups need to follow. Cloud 
                    governance requires governing your own infrastructure as well as infrastructure that you don’t totally control. Cloud governance has two key components: 
                    understanding compliance and risk and business performance goals. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Data in the cloud. Managing data in the cloud requires data security and privacy, including controls for moving data from point A to point B. It also includes managing 
                    data storage and the resources for large-scale data processing. 
                </li>
                
            </ul>

                <br>
            <p class="Bold" id="cloudCC">Cloud Computing Concerns</p>

            <a target="_blank" href="images/issues.jpg"> <img class="pic5" src="images/issues.jpg" align="left"></a>
            <p> Perhaps the biggest concerns about cloud computing are security and privacy. The idea of handing over important data to 
                another company worries some people. Corporate executives might hesitate to take advantage of a cloud computing system 
                because they can't keep their company's information under lock and key.</p>
            <p> The counterargument to this position is that the companies offering cloud computing services live and die by their reputations.It benefits these companies to have reliable security measures in place. Otherwise, the service would lose all its clients. It's in their interest to employ the most advanced techniques to protect their clients' data.</p>
            <p>Privacy is another matter. If a client can log in from any location to access data and applications, it's possible the client's privacy could be compromised. Cloud computing companies will need to find ways to protect client privacy. One way is to use authentication techniques such as user names and passwords. Another is to employ an authorization format -- each user can access only the data and applications relevant to his or her job.</p>
            <p>Some questions regarding cloud computing are more philosophical. Does the user or company subscribing to the cloud computing service own the data? Does the cloud computing system, which provides the actual storage space, own it? Is it possible for a cloud computing company to deny a client access to that client's data? Several companies, law firms and universities are debating these and other questions about the nature of cloud computing.</p>
            <p>How will cloud computing affect other industries? There's a growing concern in the IT industry about how cloud computing could impact the business of computer maintenance and repair. If companies switch to using streamlined computer systems, they'll have fewer IT needs. Some industry experts believe that the need for IT jobs will migrate to the 
                back end of the cloud computing system.</p>
            <p>Another area of research in the computer science community is autonomic computing. An autonomic computing system is self-managing, which means the system monitors itself and takes measures to prevent or repair problems. Currently, autonomic computing is mostly theoretical. But, if autonomic computing becomes a reality, it could eliminate 
                the need for many IT maintenance jobs. </p>

            <p class="Bold" id="cloudCCS">Cloud Computing: Cheat Sheet &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>
                Stuff you need to know: 
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Cloud computing systems generally have a front end, which is what the user sees, and a back end, which does all the work. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cloud computing shares some similarities with an older model of computing called timesharing. A timesharing computer system connects multiple users to a single 
                    computer processor through dumb terminals, which have a keyboard and monitor, but leave the computing to the central machine. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    While cloud computing promises to offload tasks like data storage and processing power, the model raises questions about data accessibility and security. How can you 
                    insure that you can get to your data and keep it safe if it's on someone else's computer? 
                </li>
